# WordGuess

* At the top of every game, you are given but not shown a new word, attempt to guess that word
* The word resets after each guess you get correct, or everytime you loose a match
* Each reset is random, the next word could very well be different.. or by chance.. it could be the same one
* 1 game is 5 matches long
* You get 10 guesses per match, you can loose by not guessing correctly or running out of available guesses
* Each time you loose a match, a point will be added to your losses
* If your losses score reaches 5 it's game over
* If you get 5 right you win a match
* Win 5 matches and you beat the game !

* Current word to guess is displayed in developer tools for the purpose of confirming functionality
* This app was designed during the completion of a boot camp for the purpose of demonstration and serves no real purpose
